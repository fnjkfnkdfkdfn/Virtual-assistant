# Virtual-assistant
This is  code for a virtual assistant i came up with my robotics teacher
 Warning: this code is still in beta form so not everything will be expected to work.

To get the virtual assistant up and running you need to type in the terminal python speech.py

To get the virtual assistant to take you to the sites which are on here, which are Netflix, Google chrome, Wikepedia, and Youtube you need to type open; and one of the websites listed

I will be updating this code weekly, so exepct changes every week

If you find any issues with my code pls email, zd5210351@gmail.com
